# HangmanCPP

This is my semester project which required us to make a hangman game in the terminal 
without any usage of the string library for processing strings for playing the game.

The computer selects a word from a predefined string vector randomly and you have to
guess the words correct characters until its complete.

You are given 11 trys to guess it correctly.

Enjoy !!!<3
